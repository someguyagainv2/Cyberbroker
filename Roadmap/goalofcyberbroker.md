# This is the goal of cyber broker

The goal of cyber broker isn't to store database leaks and give out confidential information the goal is to, provide companies a map of what their employees are at risk of and provide them with information on how to solve this problem if it's via GDPR Removal requests or so fourth. The goal is tl help individuals with understanding what is exposed about them and how it occurred. 

# What data is searchable

- Email
- Phone Number
- Username

# How will this data be searched

To find what emails a site has been breached in or has had any data exposed which could be from malwares / rats and more we will use sites such as haveibeenpwned, dehashed and more to request data on emails and try to map out what they're in. We can also scan usernames and phone numbers like dehashed making it good source of information there's also many other sites what support this however I'm not trying to go broke in a week as some be charging insane prices $50+, with intelx being over 1k. 

# Data what may be returned

- IPs
- Social accounts connected
- Potential passwords
- Breach information
- Can it be removed?
- Other emails
- Name
- Username

And lots more, **Now I'm fully aware that this can be used for malicious purposes I'm not blind to the dark side of the internet if a user is caught using this for Doxxing purposes or malicious purposes in targeting companies the according individual will be informed and the account will be suspended.**

# How can we provide anonymity

This is a big one as there's many factors when it comes to the handling of data and the consequences for not handling specific data on users. These consequences being people using platform for malicious use having no way to suspend their activity this is a flaw I'm admitting in my plan but to represent the fact we will NOT store data on users and will have transparency checks informing monthly what data is tracked and any changes to data regulations will **NOT have been done by me**, now why mention this specific point is that many sites what do not track users has one fundemental problem, law enforcement. Law enforcement is like meta they want information on everyone and if they don't get it, they get little angry. Any changes to data regulations will not of been done by me but forced by law enforcment pressure.

How will we protect anonymity
- Deleting network logs such as https requests to the site
- Forcing users to have HTTPS communication
- **Account creation will not ask for any PII**
- Account creation will work like mullvad vpn and generate you a random extremely long key ( if you forget it, it's game over )
- Transactions if any ( this will be done via BTC or Monero

# Good top level domains for anonymity and why

.is (Iceland) <br>
.ch (Switzerland) <br>
.li (Liechtenstein) <br>
.ru 

Now russia is controlled by ICANN, but the juristication is inside of russia meaning the stress of other countries like U.S and more can't do much to it. This doesn't mean it's invincible.

These top level domains are registered in countries with way stronger privacy laws giving external law enforcement more of a hassle in sending complaints about the data we collect being none. We understand that people will use platform for malicious intent however we are willing to deal with this problem in our own way and do not want to regulate our users with insane data collection law enforcement has shown many times that they don't like when users are able to privately post things or view things some clear examples being bf, n (dot) to, cracked.io, mysellix and way more.

# Good email searching tools which can be requested

intelx ( however is extremely pricey not viable option )
breach.vip (easy to request and allows for more than email searching)
Epieos (however this is apart of custom plan)
Dehashed (useful and offers more than email searching)
HaveIbeenpned ( doesn't return key data but returns breached data)
Spokeo (Paid not sure of API confides but is one of best tools for gathering information to identify individual)
